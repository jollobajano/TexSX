Beamer TexSX theme (starter)
============================

A **small** schoolbook Beamer theme. I have NO part in creating
this. I just put it here for future use. It is created by
[Claudio Fiandrino][2] as an answer to [this TexSX answer][1]. All
credit goes to him.

See `texsx-example.tex` for example usage.
